## Project Overview  
Employee turnover is one of the most pressing challenges organizations face. Beyond recruitment costs, high attrition impacts productivity, morale, and long-term business stability.  

To better understand the **drivers of attrition**, I built an **interactive Employee Attrition Dashboard** that provides a data-driven lens into why employees leave, how tenure affects exits, and what salary bands/roles are most vulnerable.  

This project is part of my portfolio to showcase **business-focused data storytelling** â€” transforming raw HR data into actionable insights.

## Problem Statement  
Many organizations struggle to:  
- Identify which departments experience the highest turnover.  
- Understand the financial impact of attrition.  
- Recognize salary bands or tenure groups that are more likely to exit.  
- Uncover the main reasons why employees resign.  

Without these insights, HR leaders are often **reactive** instead of **proactive**, leading to costly employee replacement cycles.  

---

## Objectives  
The main goals of this project were to:  
1. Build an interactive dashboard to monitor attrition patterns.  
2. Provide HR and leadership with **clear visibility** into employee turnover.  
3. Pinpoint the **cost of attrition** by department.  
4. Discover correlations between **salary bands, tenure, and exit rates**.  
5. Highlight the **top exit reasons** for better policy and engagement strategies.

## Dataset  
The dataset used simulates HR records containing:  
- Employee demographics  
- Department and job role  
- Tenure (years at company)  
- Salary band ($)  
- Exit reason (categorical)  
- Attrition flag (Exited / Still employed)  

**Dataset size**: 1,200 employees  
**Total exits**: 367 employees (â‰ˆ31%)

## Process & Analysis  
Steps taken in this project:  
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ handled missing values, standardized salary bands, and created tenure categories.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis** â€“ segmented attrition by department, salary, tenure, and reasons.  
3. **KPI Design** â€“ created key HR metrics such as:  
   - Attrition Rate  
   - Average Tenure at Exit  
   - Cost of Attrition by Department  
4. **Visualization** â€“ built interactive charts in Excel to make the findings accessible and business-friendly.

## Dashboard Features 
The dashboard highlights:  
- **KPI Cards**: Total Employees, Total Leavers, Attrition Rate, Average Tenure at Exit.  
- **Top Exit Reasons**: Visualizes the leading causes of attrition such as work-life balance, manager issues, and career growth.  
- **Attrition by Department**: Shows department-level turnover, with Finance experiencing the highest (37%).  
- **Attrition by Tenure Group**: Categorizes exits into career stages:  
  - 0â€“1 years (new hires)  
  - 2â€“5 years (short stay)  
  - 6â€“10 years (mid stay)  
  - 11â€“20 years (long stay)  
  - 20+ years (very long stay / outliers)  
- **Attrition by Salary Band**: Displays how turnover varies across different pay brackets.  
- **Cost of Attrition by Department**: Quantifies the financial loss due to employee exits, with Finance ($532K) and Marketing ($513K) being most impacted.

## Key Insights  
- **Finance Department** leads in attrition with **37% turnover**.  
- **Work-life balance** is the top driver of employee exits.  
- New hires (**0â€“1 years**) account for the largest share of leavers.  
- Employees in salary bands **300â€“800** and **2800â€“3300** face the highest attrition (35%).  
- Attrition costs are most severe in **Finance ($532K)** and **Marketing ($513K)**.

## Tools Used  
- **Excel** â€“ Data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and dashboard design.  
- **Pivot Tables & Charts** â€“ For aggregated analysis.  
- **Conditional Formatting** â€“ To highlight trends and outliers.

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how HR data can be transformed into a **decision-support tool**. With clear KPIs and insights, HR leaders can:  
- Develop better retention strategies.  
- Address department-specific issues.  
- Improve salary/benefit competitiveness.  
- Target interventions at early-career employees most likely to leave.
